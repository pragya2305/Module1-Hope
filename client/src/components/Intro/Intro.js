            <h2>Dear participants, I welcome you all to this program. </h2>
            <p>I, Ms Freyana Shinde am the developer of the program and currently a research scholar at the Amity Institute of Behavioural and Allied Sciences, Mumbai.
Suicidal thoughts have been noted to be a coping mechanism to end psychological and emotional pain felt by a person. Through this program, it is my aim that we should be able to learn how to recognise our negative thinking patterns, how to use effective techniques to deal with stressful situations and in turn reinforce/strengthen them into our daily routine. This program will help you to understand various terms like hope, learned optimism, gratitude, character strengths and positive emotions. 
This program is designed in such a way that it will use a step by step process and it will enable you to build competence in dealing with suicidal thoughts and increase your well-being. I hope that this program will help all of you and always remember that we are all connected and we affect each other too!</p>
