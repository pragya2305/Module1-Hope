//  There are several key differences between how pessimistic and optimistic people tend to think about the bad and good things that happen to them
// (Seligman, 1991, 1998; Seligman et al., 1995). More specifically, people who
// are optimistic make external, variable, and specific attributions for failure-like
// events rather than the internal, stable, and global attributions made by pessimists. For example, a person who is optimistic will explain a relationship
// breakup as being due to a poor match between herself and her partner (external), and something that is unlikely to happen in her next relationship (variable), as this negative event is confined to this particular relationship (specific).
// In contrast, a pessimistic person in the same situation is likely to view the
// breakup as her fault because she was not pretty enough, caring enough, or
// good at opening up to other people (internal), and she will predict that such a
// poor outcome is likely to occur in future relationships (stable), as this negative
// event is likely to be repeated should she even find another person to connect
// with (global). When it comes to explaining successful events or outcomes, the
// optimist will attribute the success to internal, stable, and global factors while
// the pessimist will explain his or her success as the result of external, variable,
// and specific attributions.<br />
//  Learning to consider alternative explanations for adverse events and to
// choose the one that is most variable and specific (rather than stable and global) is key to increasing optimism. In order to be able to effectively dispute
// your thoughts and beliefs in a variety of situations, you can set out to find
// concrete evidence that your beliefs are faulty. Becoming skilled at arguing
// with yourself is the key to the ABCDE technique (Seligman, 2002).
//  In order to effectively dispute your own pessimistic thoughts, you must first
// be able to recognize them and then to treat these thoughts as if someone else
// had said them to you. Indeed, we are often better able to dispute what other
// people say to us than what we say to ourselves (Seligman, 2002). One way
// to argue with yourself when you identify a pessimistic belief is to ask yourself the questions: “ What is the evidence for the belief? ” and “ What alternative ways can I look at this situation? ” When you identify a pessimistic
// belief that is warranted, you might then ask yourself “ What does this negative event really mean – is the outcome as negative as I am making it out to
// be? ” or ask yourself “ How useful is it for me to dwell on this negative event
// or belief? ” (Seligman, 2002).<br />
//  In this exercise you are being asked to pay attention to any A dverse experiences that you have over the course of the next few weeks that lead you
// to think like a pessimist. Next, write down your B eliefs about the adverse
// events and the C onsquences of these pessimistic beliefs. Then vigorously
// D ispute your current beliefs in order to feel more E nergized and optimistic
// about the adversities. If you find it difficult to dispute the thoughts on your
// own, turning to a friend or a loved one for help in finding the disputation
// may be helpful. Please record at least five disputation examples in the
// spaces provided below.<br />
//  Two examples of completed ABCDE disputation records are provided
// below for your reference. The first example is about a bad event and the
// second is about a good event.

//                                 my review, she is probably right that my personality is not as naturally outgoing as many of the other salespeople. I am not always
//                                 comfortable talking to all of the customers and that probably
//                                 shows through, but at the same time, I am not completely incapable as she made it seem. I guess she must see this on some level
//                                 since she still wants me to work there, just in a different position.
//                                 If she really disliked me, she could have just fired me. Maybe I
//                                 am taking this too personally. I really do like my colleagues and the
//                                 pay is pretty good. I guess in the stockroom I will have more time
//                                 to interact with my colleagues and I don’t have to worry so much
// about my wardrobe. Professional work clothes are expensive!<br />

// by how the review focused only on the negatives, but I know my
// boss had a lot of reviews to do that day so she was probably just
// trying to conserve time. It was hard to admit that I am not as outgoing as some of my colleagues, but I do realize that this is
// the case. I am actually looking forward to spending more time
// with my colleagues in the stock room and not feeling so on edge
