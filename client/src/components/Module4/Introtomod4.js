In this module, you will daily be focusing on feelings of being thankful for something. It is important for us to remember that we need to focus on the things that we genuinely feel thankful or grateful for, that is the first instant thought of a person or thing that pops up in our mind when we hear the word ‘grateful’ and not the things that people say we should be grateful for.
