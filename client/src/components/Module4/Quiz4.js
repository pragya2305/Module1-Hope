            <p><u>Instructions:</u> After a week of practising gratitude, let’s take a quick quiz to understand how gratitude relates to us. Each statement has a range of options from ‘never’ to ‘more than once a week’. You need to choose the option best suited for you for that statement. Try not to over think it and choose the answer that you feel best describes you.
